>After the summer's yield, Lord, it is time
>to let your shadow lengthen on the sundials
>and in the pastures let the rough winds fly.

This is a stanza from one of my favorite poets, Rainer Maria Rilke. 



* I grew up in the Kansas City area. I'm 18 years old and a sophomore (woo young) and have an older brother as well as a sister in law
* The dreams of the future which I have are sparse. I hope someday to become a law professor, but I wouldn't mind becoming a software engineer or a computer technician. It's difficult 
* It's pretty difficult to talk about myself. I enjoy a variety of activities, and have dabbled in various things in my life
  * These include things like competitive swimming, quizbowl, chess, writing, piano, et cetra
