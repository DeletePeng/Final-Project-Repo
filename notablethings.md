# Some interesting things I have learned about mythology

So, this is pretty neat. Horus,  the god of the sky challenged Set, the god of death to a race in boats made of stone. Only problem?



*Horus took a wooden boat and painted it to look like stone!*

So obviously, Set got pretty mad about that and turned into a hippo to attack Horus when his boat just flat out sank.  Unfortunately though, Horus ended up becoming King of Egypt so, that's quite sad.

### Japanese Myth, anyone?

Here is [A source] in case you are interested in this. 

Kappas are a type of Japanese monster. They live in rivers apparently, eat cucumbers and have a liquid filled dent in its head. Unfortunately, they also drag people underwater and steal your organs, so **best not to approach them!**
